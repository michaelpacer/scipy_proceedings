Dear {{author}},

Congratulations on having your abstract accepted for this year's event -- we 
look forward to seeing your poster or presentation! As in the past, SciPy2018 
will release a conference proceedings prior to the start of the conference, 
and you are invited to contribute a full-length paper (up to 8 pages) expanding 
on your abstract.

The proceedings are aimed at highlighting significant contributions to 
scientific computing in Python, such as:

- new software packages that support the Scientific Python Stack
- domain-specific applications of Python in any field of research
- significant improvements to existing software packages
- hardware systems designed to support the Python stack
- applications of scientific computing in education

Papers must be submitted as pull requests by {{submission_date}}. At that
point, the six-week open review period will begin. During this time, members
from the program committee and the scientific Python community at large will
provide feedback, which should be addressed through discussion on GitHub and by
updating the pull request.

When submitting a paper to the proceedings, you may be contacted by the
Proceedings Chairs to assist in reviewing at least one paper.

Further instructions can be found here:
